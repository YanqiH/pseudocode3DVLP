Function step4:
Inputs: measuredPr, pred_h, m, G
Outputs: result
  Set Pt
  Set H to 3 - hrx % calculate vertical distance between transmitters and receiver
  Set Rx as receiver's real coordinate % only to calculate pe but not used in positioning process

  Calculate da using cal_r function with inputs measuredPr(4), Pt, G, m, H
  Calculate db using cal_r function with inputs measuredPr(5), Pt, G, m, H
  Calculate dc using cal_r function with inputs measuredPr(6), Pt, G, m, H
  Calculate dd using cal_r function with inputs measuredPr(7), Pt, G, m, H % calculate distances between transmitters and receiver using proposed environment-aware algorithm using m and G

  Calculate estimated position xe using inputs LED positions and da, db, dc, dd

  Calculate prediction error pe as the Euclidean distance between estimated position and real position

  Set result array including xe and pe
  Return result
