Inputs: Pr, m0, m4, m8, m12, m16, m200, G0, G4, G8, G12, G16, G200 % m and G from previous work
Output: diff_0, diff_4, diff_8, diff_12, diff_16, diff_200

     For each hrx in [0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0]:

        Set corresponding tM based on hrx value.
        Call step3(Pr, m, G, hrx, tM) to get results (result_d, X_estih).
        Store X_estih and result_d for later use.

    For each hrx in [0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0]:

        Calculate estimated distances from each point (A, B, C, D) to the estimated Rx position.
        
    Calculate real distances from each point (A, B, C, D) to the real Rx position Pr.

    For each hrx in [0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0]:

        Calculate the difference between the estimated distances and the distances calculated from the estimated Rx position.
        Compute variance and standard deviation of these differences.
        Sum the absolute values of these differences.

    Return diff_0, diff_4, diff_8, diff_12, diff_16, diff_200
